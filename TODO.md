# TODO

In approximate order of decreasing importance:

* `WhatsApp/Backups`: delete any top-level files that do not exist remotely.
* Option to filter by file type.
* Interactive mode.
* Option to list files only present in archive.
* When timestamps differ but sizes match, compare content.
* Maintain an index of files and content hashes.
